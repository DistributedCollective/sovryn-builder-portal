# Usage at Sovryn

Sovryn uses the UI Library to help create better products, more efficiently, with a consistent brand identity and user experience.

1. It ensures consistency in the design of all products and services, making them easily recognizable to users. This consistency can improve the overall user experience and help establish trust with users.
2. It streamlines the design process, making it faster and more efficient for designers to create new products and features. This can lead to cost savings and faster time-to-market.
3. It can scale to accommodate changes and growth in Sovryn. It can be updated and expanded as needed to support new products and services.\


In order to create an interface that helps users manage their funds in the most transparent way:

1. We used variations of Sovrynâ€™s brand colors to create emphasis on the elements that are relevant to the flow.
2. We used different sizes and spacing to create hierarchy between the different elements and sections.
3. We used components from the Sovryn UI Library to create consistency between the different devices to help users navigate and operate the platform easily.
