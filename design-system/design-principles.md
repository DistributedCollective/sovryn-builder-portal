# Design Principles

Sovryn design principles focus on six key themes:

1. Consistency
2. Scalability
3. Accessibility
4. Flexibility
5. Clear and concise communication
6. Modular design



To put these principles into practice, we adhere to three major principles/patterns:

1. Atomic Design System - a method of breaking design elements down into reusable components for scalability. [https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
2. First-class mobile support - prioritizing accessibility, spacing, and sizing to reinforce hierarchy and provide a comparable experience across devices.
3. Sovryn Brand Guidelines - a set of guidelines that ensure consistent typography, spacing, and colors for a cohesive look and feel.
