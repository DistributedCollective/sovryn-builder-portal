# Lending

Users can deposit funds into the lending pool in exchange for iTokens. iTokens automatically increase in value as interest is generated. The height of the interest depends on the utilization rate and the interest curve.&#x20;

When users wish to withdraw their funds, they burn iTokens and exchange them to the underlying asset according to the current iToken price. It may not be possible to burn all iTokens at a time. Only assets currently available on the loan token contract may be withdrawn.
