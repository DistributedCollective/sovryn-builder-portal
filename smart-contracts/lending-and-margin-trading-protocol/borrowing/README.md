# Borrowing

It is possible to borrow funds from the loan tokens contract with any of the supported tokens as collateral. The collateral currency needs to differ from the loan currency. Borrowing funds from the lending pools opens a position on the Sovryn Protocol. Consequently, in order to close an open position partially or completely, one has to interact with the Sovryn Protocol.
