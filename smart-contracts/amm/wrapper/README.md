# Wrapper

The wrapper contract can be used to directly swap to or from RBTC without requiring an additional transaction to wrap or unwrap WRBTC.

Providing liquidity with the wrapper has the benefit that RBTC is automatically wrapped to WRBTC and the pool tokens are automatically deposited at the liquidity mining contract.
