# Sovryn Builder Portal

### **Welcome to the Sovryn Builder Portal!**

We created this resource to help builders in the Sovryn community find the tools they need to integrate with the Sovryn protocol, create new applications with our design system and UI library, and contribute to Sovryn open-source projects.\
\
Use the tools documented here to build:

* Wallets with integrated self-custodial trading, lending, and borrowing
* Decentralized finance and exchange aggregators
* A bankless neobank that runs on BTC-backed stablecoins
* An in-game economy with its own assets and p2p exchange

... and more exciting products and projects we haven't thought of yet.

Take a look around! Then if you still have questions, or just want to talk shop with other Sovryn builders, we invite you to join the [#integrations channel](https://discord.gg/sovryn) on the Sovryn Discord server.
