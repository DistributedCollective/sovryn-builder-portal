# Contribution

The UI Library is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome.&#x20;

Follow these steps if you would like to contribute to the library's development:

* Follow [development instructions](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-dapp#development) to run the UI Library locally.
* Read [the Contributing section](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-dapp#contributing) if you're not familiar with it.
* Create a component, Jest unit tests, and a Storybook story as described in [Working with Components](working-with-components.md).
* For questions regarding the implementation, the best approach is to create a draft PR. Write a comment with a thorough explanation of the component, its API, purpose, and anything else you find important. At this stage, the component can be just a mock and you can iteratively make it better after discussions with our core members in the PR.
* Every PR will be reviewed by our core contributors so don't lose hope if it's not reviewed right away. If you think that adding your component is really urgent or you need to discuss something else that cannot be resolved in the PR, you can try to reach us via the [official Sovryn Discord](https://discord.gg/sovryn).
