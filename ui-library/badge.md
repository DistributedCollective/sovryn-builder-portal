# Badge

## Description

Toggle is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. Toggles are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips the switch”. They are commonly used for “on/off” switches.

Scale labels variations (future dev) We’ll add an option for labels inside the toggle switch
