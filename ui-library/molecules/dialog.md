# Dialog

## Description

Dialogs focus the user’s attention exclusively on one task or piece of information via a window that sits on top of the page content.

A dialog is triggered by a user’s action, appears on top of the main page content, and is persistent until dismissed. The purpose of a dialog should be immediately apparent to the user, with a clear and obvious path to completion.
