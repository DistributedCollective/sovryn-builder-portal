# Overview

We set out to build our new application with the following goals in mind:

* Mobile first design - the dapp should function the same on both mobile and desktop, with a focus on simple UX
* Consistent design system - faster design speed and easier to scale products
* Build building blocks - [UI Library](../ui-library/overview.md), [The Graph](../other-products/the-graph/overview.md), [sovryn-onboard](../sovryn-onboard/overview.md), [Smart Router](../sovryn-sdk/smart-router/) - developers should be able to use the same tools we work with, to build their own products on Sovryn ecosystem
