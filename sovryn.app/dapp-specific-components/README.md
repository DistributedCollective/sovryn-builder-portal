# Dapp specific components

Whilst most of our Dapp UI is constructed directly from the components in the [Sovryn UI Library](../../ui-library/overview.md), some of the UI components we use in sovryn.app must be opinionated in order to provide required functionality without putting business logic into library components.

In this section we document those components that have standardized variations which can be used by our teams to quickly construct consistent UX across the board, without the need to re-implement complex logic.
